# StringManipulation
Python Variables and Data Types

Scenario
As a programmer for CITE MS you are required to create a series of small applications to work with numbers and strings. Some of these applications you have not been given any pseudo code for others you are provided with a design in the form of pseudo code to follow when building the application.
Each of these applications will perform small but useful tasks for CITE MS.

Question 1
You have been tasked with writing some Python code that will be later used by other Python developers that have been hired as part of the team. As a junior programmer you have been assigned the task of creating pieces of code to perform String manipulation related tasks.
Write some Python code that does all of the following in sequence:

1.	Takes input from the user and stores the input inside of a String.
2.	Replace three different commonly misspelled words with the correct spelling within the String and print out the String variable contents afterwards. (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_misspelled_English_words)
